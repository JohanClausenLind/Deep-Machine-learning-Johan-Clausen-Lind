# Deep learning - AI21

This is a course with focus of learning concepts in deep learning both theory and practice using primarily **Keras** in TensorFlow, but other tools will also be used. This course will build upon prior skills in:

- pandas
- machine learning
- visualising data
- fundamental statistics
- fundamental linear algebra

All lecture codes and exercises can be found in the course [Github repo][ghr].

## Schedule

Week 16 will focus on basic , week 17-18 on computer vision and convolutional neural networks. Week 19-21 will focus on NLP, starting with RNN, LSTM, Autoencoder to state-of-the-art transformers.

## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).
