# Deep learning - AI21

Deep learning course

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is a course with focus of learning concepts in deep learning using primarily **TensorFlow**, but other tools will also be used. This course will build upon prior skills in:

- pandas
- machine learning
- visualising data
- fundamental statistics
- fundamental linear algebra

All lecture codes and exercises can be found in the course [Github repo][ghr].

## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).
