## Kaggle setup
In Kaggle, you can work with public datasets as well as your private datasets, and you can enable GPU and TPU for certain amount of weekly hours quota, which Kaggle provides for you for free. To use Kaggle with own dataset do the following:

1. Login to your Kaggle account and create a notebook. 
2. File -> upload dataset (provide a zip-file for folders)
3. Add dataset to your notebook, also you can import a notebook that you have worked on your local workstation 
4. Turn on GPU (remember to turn it off when finished with your work)

Note that a Kaggle session is limited to around 6 hours, and is also dependant on Internet access. Hence when working with Kaggle it is of utter importance to save down the training progress into files, in which you can load again and continue.
